# What is this?

This is a small sample for using Angular's fakeAsync test helper in a nest.js application.

Most of the code was autogenerated by the awesome nest cli. There are two main files of interest: `spec/test.spec.ts` shows a small working demo of the `fakeAsync` function in action. `helpers/fakeAsync.ts` contains the actual function definitions. You may also be interested to look at the contents of the `package.json`.

# How did we get here?

I first created a new nestjs service with

    nest new fake-async

Then I installed the necessary dependencies.

    npm install --save-dev zone.js @types/zone.js

I then installed and set up jasmine

    npm install --save-dev jasmine @types/jasmine

Then I created `fakeAsync.ts`. Of import: the right `import` statements at the top.
